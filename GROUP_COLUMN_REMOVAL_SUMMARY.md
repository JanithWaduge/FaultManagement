# Group Column Removal Summary

## ✅ Changes Completed

### 🗑️ **Removed Group Column from Fault Review Panel Table**

The group column has been completely removed from the fault review panel table as it's no longer needed after removing the group assignment functionality.

## 🔧 **Technical Changes Made**

### 1. **Table Header Array Update**

- **File**: `Frontend/src/Dashboard.js`
- **Change**: Removed "Group" from the table headers array
- **Before**: Array included "Group" between "Assigned To" and "Reported At"
- **After**: Direct sequence from "Assigned To" to "Reported At"

### 2. **Table Body Cell Removal**

- **File**: `Frontend/src/Dashboard.js`
- **Change**: Removed the group data cell that displayed group information
- **Before**:
  ```javascript
  <td>{f.isGrouped && f.groupSize > 1 ? `Group (${f.groupSize})` : "-"}</td>
  ```
- **After**: Completely removed this table cell

### 3. **Column Span Adjustment**

- **File**: `Frontend/src/Dashboard.js`
- **Change**: Updated colSpan for empty state row
- **Before**: `colSpan={isResolved ? 13 : 14}`
- **After**: `colSpan={isResolved ? 12 : 13}`
- **Reason**: Reduced by 1 due to removing one column

### 4. **Column Index Updates**

- **File**: `Frontend/src/Dashboard.js`
- **Change**: Updated responsive class index references
- **Impact**:
  - Actions column: `i === 10` → `i === 9`
  - Photos column: `i === 11` → `i === 10`
  - Notes/Reported At responsive class: `i === 9` → `i === 8`
